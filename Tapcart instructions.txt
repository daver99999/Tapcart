The SD card must be formatted Fat16 or Fat32. Large SD cards are usually Not formatted that way. I recomment a SD card that is 32 GB or less.
Copy the browser.prg to the root of the tapcart
Copy any programs you want into a directory on the tapcart.

Make sure the C64 Power is off.
Insert the SD card into the tapcart and carefullt attach it to your C64.
Press and Hold Shift then click Run/Stop.

You will see a message to press play on tape for a second then Browser.prg will load. This program Allows you to load any programs you would like.
